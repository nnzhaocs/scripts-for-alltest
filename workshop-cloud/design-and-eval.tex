\section{Registry with deduplication support}
\label{sec:file_adressable}

%Our analysis in Section~\ref{sec:redundant_files} suggests that adding the
%support of file-level deduplication to Docker registry can significantly reduce
%its storage capacity requirements, especially in large-scale deployments.
%
As the number of images stored in Docker registry is increasing dramatically,
storing and managing the large proportion of redundant files requires both
storage equipment and administration investment. 
In this section, as an
alternative to layer-level content addressable storage, a file-level content
addressable storage model (\sysname) is suggested for Docker registry to remove
redundant files and save space while maintaing good performance.  

In this section, we first describe a high-level design of \emph{\sysname}---
a Docker registry that supports file-level deduplication.
We then proceed with a simulation-based evaluation of the expected performance
implications.
We also provide suggestions on how one can efficiently server push/pull requests.
