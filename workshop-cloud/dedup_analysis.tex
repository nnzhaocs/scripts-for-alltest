\section{Deduplication analysis}
\label{sec:redundant_files}
%\NZ{I would like to add some general analysis before dedup analysis.}
%\LR{The figures in the whole section are very hard to read in black and white
%and I think the dots in Fig. 6 are even hard to read in color. We should change
%the colors to ones that are better distinguishable and add patterns to lines
%and bars.}\NZ{addressed}

In this section, we investigate the potential for data reduction in the
Docker registry by estimating the efficacy of layer sharing,
compression, and the proposed file-level deduplication.
%
We also analyze the root causes of the high file redundancy
across container images.
%
%We first analyze the benefits of data reduction
%techniques that Docker already implements---layer sharing and local
%compression.
%
%\LR{We should introduce the term layer-level deduplication in the previous
%section.}
%
%\VT{Lukas, I rephrased and changed to layer sharing, which was introduced in
%prev. section. c if it reads better now.}
%\NZ{changed to layer-sharing.}
%
%Docker, in its current state, already performs rudimentary deduplication by
%sharing identical layers between images.
%
%We start our analysis from quantifying how much benefits does this existing
%approach provides.
%
%However, we believe that there is significantly more potential in
%deduplicating individual files in the layers.
%
%We then use the same dataset to estimate the efficacy of file-level
%deduplication and analyze the root causes of the high file redundancy found
%across container images.
