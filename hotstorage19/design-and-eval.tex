\section{\sysname~Design}
\label{sec:slimmer}

%Our analysis in Section~\ref{sec:redundant_files} suggests that adding the
%support of file-level deduplication to Docker registry can significantly reduce
%its storage capacity requirements, especially in large-scale deployments.
%
%In this section, we first describe a high-level design of \emph{\sysname}---
%a Docker registry that supports file-level deduplication.
%We then proceed with a simulation-based evaluation of the expected performance
%implications.

%Integrated Caching and Deduplication

%Cache-assisted Inline deduplication system


In this section, we first present the challenges brought by the unique characteristics of the Docker ecosystem.
Next, we discuss our design goals and finally present the design of~\sysname. 
%Then we present the design of~\sysname. 
%O are to improve Docker registry performance and to decrease the backend storage requirements such as ???.
