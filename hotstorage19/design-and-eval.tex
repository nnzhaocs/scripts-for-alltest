\section{\sysname~design}
\label{sec:slimmer}

%Our analysis in Section~\ref{sec:redundant_files} suggests that adding the
%support of file-level deduplication to Docker registry can significantly reduce
%its storage capacity requirements, especially in large-scale deployments.
%
%In this section, we first describe a high-level design of \emph{\sysname}---
%a Docker registry that supports file-level deduplication.
%We then proceed with a simulation-based evaluation of the expected performance
%implications.

%Integrated Caching and Deduplication

%Cache-assisted Inline deduplication system


In this section, we present the design of~\sysname. 
\HA{First we start with the challenges brought by the unique characteristics of the Docker ecosystem?}
Our goal is to largely improve registry performance and significantly decrease the storage requirements on backend storage systems.
