\input{fig-sys-overview}

Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview} shows the architecture of \sysname.
 \sysname comprises a cluster of registry servers and a distributed metadata database. 
%Layers are stored in the registry cluster. 
Each server in the \sysname~registry cluster uses part of its storage for storing assembled (\ie preconstructed) layers. 
We name such storage: user behavior based layer preconstruct cache (\preconstructcachename).
Another part, a layer restoring performance %latency
aware deduplication system (\dedupname system), is for storing deduplicated files. 
Such files' metadata (\eg Docker image manifests) is kept in a metadata store; a distributed NoSQL database for 
reliability, consistency, and fast accesses.

We now describe how Docker clients interact with \sysname.

\paragraph{Push}

%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}, 
Consider a Docker client, client \textit{A}, who creates a new hello-world image
\texttt{hello-world:new}
from the official image which only contains a single layer \textit{L1}. 
Pushing a new version of hello-world image corresponds to performing a PUT of layer \textit{L2} to the registry and a PUT of manifest to the metadata store as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}. 
%first PUT
Because the registry already stores \textit{L1}, 
%only the modifications to the hello-world image that are commited as a new layer \textit{L2}, 
only the compressed \textit{L2} tarball is PUT to the registry reflecting the modifications to the hello-world image.
When \sysname~receives \textit{L2}, 
it will cache \textit{L2} in the \preconstructcachename~for later accesses,
and at the same time submit \textit{L2} to the backend storage system (Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}).
The \preconstructcachename~uses write through policies. 
Since layers are immutable, no data consistency issue exists between the \preconstructcachename~and the backend storage system.
% Second PUT (manifest)
The addition of layer \textit{L2} to the hello-world image is reflected in the manifest \textit{M1:0} which is PUT to the registry.
Putting the new manifest \textit{M1:0} to the registry for the new image \texttt{hello-world:new} conlcudes the process of pushing it.



The \dedupname~process runs periodically to deduplicate compressed layer tarballs (detailed in~\cref{sec:dedup-desgin})
into unique files to save storage space.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}, cold layer \textit{L2} is selected to be deduplicated.
The \dedupname~process decompresses \textit{L2}, removes duplicate files from the \emph{uncompressed} \textit{L2}, and  evenly distributes the remaining unique files across the registry servers.
This way, each server stores a 
%\textbf{deduplicated slice}
unique \textbf{slice}
 of the deduplicated \textit{L2}, from which a layer comprising a \textbf{slice} of \textit{L2}
can be constructed and cached in the \preconstructcachename. We define such layer as a {\em slice layer}.
We define all the per-server files belonging to a layer as a {\em deduplicated slice}. 
Each server stores deduplicated slices belonging to many layers. 
A layer is represented as a set of deduplicated slices that are distributed across multiple servers.
The layer can be restored 
%to a compressed layer tarball 
from those distributed slices. 
Such distribution allows restoring a layer in parallel.
%To do that, 
%\dedupname~process uses copy-on-write to update the old manifest \textit{M1:0} by adding slices' digests into it 
%and generates new manifest \textit{M1:1} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}.
To do that, the \dedupname~process generates a new manifest \textit{M1:1} that holds, in addition to the contents of the old manifest \textit{M1:0}, the digests to the unique slices %comprising
that make up the layer as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}.
The slice digest is calculated by hashing the slice content~\cite{xxx}.

\paragraph{Pull}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview},
when client \textit{C} pulls an official image \texttt{hello-world} from the registry,
\sysname~first checks if the requested layer \textit{L1} is present in~\preconstructcachename.
If so, the \texttt{GET} layer request will be served by the cache.
Otherwise, the \dedupname~system starts a parallel layer restoring process by serving slice layers from their hosting servers.
For example, when client \textit{B} pulls the \texttt{hello-world:new} image from the registry,
\sysname~sends the latest manifest (\textit{M1:1}) to client \textit{B}.
After receiving \textit{M1:1}, client \textit{B} 
%first 
parses \textit{M1:1} to get a list of slice digests for \textit{L2}.
Then, instead of sending a ``\texttt{pull layer L2}'' request, client \textit{B} will send multiple ``\texttt{pull slice of L2}'' requests to the registry.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}, client \textit{B} sends ``\texttt{pull slice S1}'', ``\texttt{pull slice S2}'', and 
``\texttt{pull slice S3}'' to the registry 
since \textit{L2} is comprised of the slices \textit{S1}, \textit{S2}, and \textit{S3}.
These requests are forwarded to the servers that store the corresponding deduplicated slice of \textit{L2}.
%On \sysname~side, \textit{L2} is stored as deduplicated slices distributed across different servers.
The servers will start to restore slices, i.e. compose slice layers, from local deduplicated slices and send the compressed slices to the client 
in parallel %as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}. 
When client \textit{B} receives all the slices, it decompresses them together into an uncompressed layer.

\paragraph{Docker client modifications}
 
To interact with \sysname, Docker client is modified to 
parse \sysname~manifest with additional attributes -- slice digests.
If slice digests present in a layer object in the manifest JSON file, 
client will replace ``\texttt{pull layer} request with multiple ``\texttt{pull slice}'' requests.
Besides, when client receives slices back from registry, 
it decompresses these slices together into an uncompressed layer.  
%When a user requests a
%layer that is not present in the layer buffer, the request is forwarded to the
%file cache (detailed in~\cref{sec:design_operations}). 
%If a layer is also not found in the
%file cache, the request is forwarded to the backend dedup storage system.
%Note that after layer deduplication, unique files are
%scattered across multiple servers. 
%We define all the per-server files belonging to a layer as a {\em slice}. 
%A server stores slices for many layers, and a layer is composed of slices stored on multiple servers.
%To avoid the network latency caused by fetching slices from different servers and
%assembling them into a whole compressed layer, we split a \texttt{pull} request 
%into several~\texttt{pull slice}~requests. Those requests will then be
%forwarded to all the backend servers that store the requested
%layer's slices. 
%After a~\texttt{pull slice}~request is received, each backend server compresses the slice 
%and directly sends it back to the user.
%We modify the Docker client
%interface such that when it receives all the compressed slices, it can
%decompress them into a single layer. 
%Furthermore, compressing slices in parallel considerably lowers the layer compression latency,
%since compression time depends on the size of the
%uncompressed data.
%to cache layers and cache unique files after decompression and deduplication,
%respectively.  consists of a \emph{layer buffer} and a \emph{file cache}.  The
%layer buffer stores all the newly pushed layers in memory.  Although accessing
%memory is very fast, the size of main memory is limited. 
%All the slices for a layer are fetched in parallel for performance improvement.






%\sysname~seamlessly integrates 
%%the management of 
%caching and deduplication on the
%backend storage system (\emph{backend dedup storage}) with Docker registries.
%%
%We address a set of unique challenges to enable this integration.
%%
%First, for caching layers, \texttt{pull} layer requests are difficult to
%predict because layers are accessed infrequently.
%In~\cref{sec:background},
%%\arb{???}, 
%we have observed that about half of the layers are not
%accessed again for at least $1.3$~hours. Which means that if we
%cache a layer, we may need to wait a long time before we observe a hit on that layer.  %(as discussed in~\cref{sec:background}).  
%This is mainly 
%because when a user pulls an image from the registry, the Docker daemon on the
%requesting host will only pull the layers that are not locally stored.
%%\Ali{I do not understand the following sentence.}
%%Moreover, we have to consider that a user might deploy an applications on
%%multiple machines, so it's not easy to predict when a user will access which layers. 
%%%\Ali{The above statement is incorrect. You have to distinguish between GET layer requests
%%that are issued after a (PUSH layer + GET manifest) request and a normal GET layer request.
%%FAST paper only talk about case 1. Whereas you are generalizing that any GET layer request
%%should have a precedent GET layer request which is wrong. We can make a case
%%that not all GET layers requests have a precedent PUSH layer request but we can
%%not say that it takes a few days, weeks, or even months for a user to make a pull
%%layer request after a push layer request.}
%%\NZ{I mean the first case, push beyond your trace collection time.}
%%
%
%Second, we can not deduplicate compressed layers. For deduplication, each layer
%needs to be uncompressed, and only then can undergo file-level deduplication. Similarly,
%to restore a layer, we need to fetch files from multiple servers, and only then compress
%them in to a tar file to serve a \texttt{pull} layer request. 
%%\arb{that can service the ??? request}\NZ{addressed}. 
%This whole process can incur a 
%considerable performance overhead on \texttt{pull} layer requests.
%Deduplication also slows down
%\texttt{push} layer requests because of its high demand for CPU, memory, I/O, and network resources.
%%\Ali{Explain how push layer requests are not effected?}\NZ{fixed}
%
%%\subsection{Design}
%To address these issues, we propose a new registry design. The key feature of our design is a user-access-history-based prefetch algorithm that helps mitigate the performance degradation due to the 
%backend dedup storage system (Figure~\ref{fig:sys-overview}). Based
%on layer access pattern we observed in~\cref{sec:background} and user access history information,
%\sysname precisely prefetch the layers that may be pulled shortly.
%%has not been pulled in the requested repository
%%and the prefetched 
%%In this case, we can   
%%a user's active time is predictable. 
%%Thus, we leverage users' behavior, \ie
%%when a user is most likely to be active, to drive layer evictions from the cache.
%
%
%%\input{fig-sift-manifest}
%
%Considering that layer sizes are typically about several MB~\cite{dockerworkload}, 
%a small main memory cache will be unable to accommodate
%all prefetched layers for all active users. 
%To address this issue, we 
%create separate caches for layers and \emph{unique} files, called {\em layer buffer} and {\em file cache}, respectively. 
%%Both caches comprise both
%%main memory and flash memory.
%%Layer buffer
%%\arb{are main memory for one type and flash for the other type, or both for both types. I assumed both types of memory are used, and there are two caches. check previous sentence for correctness.}\NZ{addressed}
%Note that, layers are  compressed tarballs and buffered in layer buffer, and 
%%sent by users
% \emph{unique} files are uncompressed files from which duplicates have been removed and stored on flash-based storage. 
%%We call compressed layer cache and \emph{deduped} files cache,
%%\emph{layer buffer} and \emph{file cache}, respectively.
%For 
%cache evictions, we first evict inactive users' layers from the layer buffer.
%Next, we \emph{dedup} the evicted layers, then store the \emph{unique} files
%into the file cache (detailed in~\cref{sec:design_operations}). 
%%the following operations: decompressing each evicted layer and comparing its
%%containing files with the files that are already stored in the file cache,
%%eliminating duplicate files, that is, only storing the unique files on flash
%%storage.
