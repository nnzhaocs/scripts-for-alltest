%\subsection{Need of Deduplication}
%
%In order to understand the extent of storage requirements and performance demands from a Docker registry. 
%We observe the amount of public repositories hosted by Docker Hub registries. 
%The number of public repositories is constantly increasing with a growth that amounts 
%to around one million repositories annually. 
%This corresponds to~130\,TB of annual growth in storage requirements (but it is acually less because of shared layers, right?), 
%costing around~\$15,000 a month if Google Cloud Storage is used~\cite{GoogleCloudStoragePricing}.
%This growth implies significant benefits to storage deduplication. 
%
%Deduplication option, block level, file level ...?
