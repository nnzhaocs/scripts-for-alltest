The proliferation of container images and the associated storage performance
and capacity requirements are the key obstacles to efficiently scaling Docker
registries.
%
Though the real-world images contain a tremendous amount of duplicate data,
modern registries cannot effectively eliminate the duplicates.
%due to the compressed format of the images.
%
In this paper, we propose a new Docker registry architecture, \emph{\sysname},
that integrates deduplication into the registry.
%
\sysname supports several configurable deduplication modes that provide
different levels of storage efficiency, durability, and performance, as
required by different use cases.
%
To further mitigate the negative impact of deduplication on the image download
and upload times, \sysname introduces a two-tier cache with a novel
user-access-history-based prefetch algorithm. 
%
Under real workloads, \sysname saves up to XXX\% of storage space while keeping
the latencies within the XXX\% of the original registry.
