\section{\sysname~Design}
\label{sec:Sift}

The main goal of \sysname is to reduce the storage demands of image registries
while keeping the performance impact on user operations (mainly image
\texttt{push} and \texttt{pull}) low.
%
In this section, we first provide an overview of
\sysname~(\S\ref{sec:overview}).
%and explain, how it utilizes existing replicas to balance the trade-off
%between storage space reduction and performance.
%
We then describe in detail how \sysname
deduplicates~(\S\ref{sec:dedup-desgin}) and
restores~(\S\ref{sec:restore-desgin}) layers, and how it further improves
performance through predictive cache management~(\S\ref{sec:cache-design}).
