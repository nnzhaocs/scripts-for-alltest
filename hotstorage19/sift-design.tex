\section{\sysname~Design}
\label{sec:Sift}

%Our analysis in Section~\ref{sec:redundant_files} suggests that adding the
%support of file-level deduplication to Docker registry can significantly reduce
%its storage capacity requirements, especially in large-scale deployments.
%
%In this section, we first describe a high-level design of \emph{\sysname}---
%a Docker registry that supports file-level deduplication.
%We then proceed with a simulation-based evaluation of the expected performance
%implications.
%Integrated Caching and Deduplication
%Cache-assisted Inline deduplication system


%In this section, we first present the challenges brought by the unique characteristics of the Docker ecosystem.
%Next, we discuss our design goals and finally present the design of~\sysname. 
%Then we present the design of~\sysname. 
%O are to improve Docker registry performance and to decrease the backend storage requirements such as ???.


The goal of \sysname is to improve the storage efficacy of registry backend storage system.
In addition to eliminates excessive duplicate data and 
significantly decreases storage capacity requirements,
\sysname more focuses on the impact of layer deduplication on \texttt{pulling} layer performance
and how to improve layer \texttt{pulling} performance while \emph{deduplicating} layers.

In this section, we outline the design of \sysname.
We present how \sysname achieves 
a maximum performance, 
a maximum data deduplication ratio, 
a trade-off between performance and data deduction
by utilizing deduplication, replication, and user behavior patterns.

% To speedup layer restoring,
% \sysname uses a parallel streaming layer deduplication and restoring process
% .
% Moreover, \sysname exploit the observed user access patterns
% and uses a user behavior based layer cache.
%In this section, we outline the design of \sysname.
%Then, we present how \sysname performs layer deduplication and layer restoring. 
%Finally, we present our user-behavior based layer preconstruct diskcache. % (\preconstructcachename).
%a latency aware deduplication system (\dedupname system) and

%\LR{In general, we need to structure this section more top-down, i.e. first introduce what are the
%challenges/difficulties that we were facing when designing Sift and then explaining how we addressed
%them and why we chose to address them that way. Otherwise, the text is just describing, how Sift
%works but the readers don't know why it works that way and why the different features are there.}
