\subsection{Deduplication performance}

We evaluated \sysname's deduplication performance by using different number of D-servers.
We use 32 clients to warmup D-servers with a certain amount of 
layers as shown in Table~\ref{tab:eval-overall},
%After receiving the layers, D-server cluster performs layer deduplication and 
%save each unique file with three file replicas. 
and measure the layer deduplication performance.
