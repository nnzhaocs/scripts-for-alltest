\subsection{Deduplication performance}

We measure \sysname's deduplication performance in \emph{B-mode 0}
with 32 clients on 21-node cluster.
%We use 32 clients to warmup D-servers with a certain amount of 
%layers as shown in Table~\ref{tab:eval-overall},
%After receiving the layers, D-server cluster performs layer deduplication and 
%save each unique file with three file replicas. 
%and measure the layer deduplication performance.
