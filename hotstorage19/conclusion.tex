\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented \sysname, a new Docker registry architecture that supports deduplication for
Docker images to reduce storage utilization. \sysname makes several design decisions to
reduce deduplication overhead and keep layer retrieval latencies low. It parallelizes
layer reconstrucion locally and across the cluster to mitigate the overhead of
compression and decompression of layers, and exploits user behavior to preconstruct
layers before they are accessed. \sysname additionally leverages caching at different
storage tiers to further improve \texttt{GET} latencies. Our evaluation shows that
we can achieve a deduplication ratio of 1.74$\times$ while only adding an overhead
of up to \gap when layers are pulled.
