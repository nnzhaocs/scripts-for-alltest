We presented \sysname, a new Docker registry architecture that integrates caching and deduplication with the Docker registry 
to
improve the registry's performance and decrease the backend storage capacity requirement. 
%The layer buffer holds hot layers that belong to active users.
%To improve the capacity limitation of the main memory cache, we utilize flash memory to store unique files since it offers fast random read access.
%The utilization of flash memory to store unique files not only mitigates the capacity limitation of the main memory cache, it also offers fast random read accesses.
% a on a distributed flash-based store.  \\
\sysname~leverages a two-tier heterogeneous cache architecture to efficiently improve cache space 
utilization. Our user-access-history-based prefetch algorithm can improve the cache hit ratio and mitigate the overhead of decompression-enabled deduplication.
