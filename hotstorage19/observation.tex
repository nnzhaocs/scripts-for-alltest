\subsection{Need of Deduplication}

In order to understand the extent of storage requirements and performance demands from a Docker registry. 
We observe the amount of public repositories hosted by Docker Hub registries. 
The number of public repositories is constantly increasing with a growth that amounts 
to around one million repositories annually. 
This corresponds to~130\,TB of annual growth in storage requirements (but it is acually less because of shared layers, right?), 
costing around~\$15,000 a month if Google Cloud Storage is used~\cite{GoogleCloudStoragePricing}.
This growth implies significant benefits to storage deduplication. 

Deduplication option, block level, file level ...?

Our in-depth and empirical analysis of the viability of deduplication on container images we collected from Docker Hub. In this analysis, we provide insights in terms of similarities/redundancies in the image data. 

The proliferation of Containers and Container platforms has resulted in an explosion of the number of Docker images.
