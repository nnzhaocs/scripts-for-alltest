\subsection{Need of Deduplication}

In order to understand the extent of storage requirements and performance demands of a Docker registry. We keep track of the amount of public repositories hosted by Docker Hub registries. The number of public repositories is constantly increasing with a growth that amounts to around one million repositories annually.

This amounts to about storage implication, how dedup will help, layer ref count
