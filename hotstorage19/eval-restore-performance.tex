\subsection{Restoring performance breakdown}

We breakdown \sysname's layer restoring performance in \emph{B-mode 0}
with 32 clients on 21-node cluster as shown in Figure~\ref{xxx}.% by using different number of D-servers.
%Before we replay traces on the D-server cluster, 
%We first warmup D-servers with a certain amount of layers for each workload as shown in Table~\ref{tab:eval-overall}.
%After that,
%and save each unique file with three file replicas.
%After all warmup layers are deduplicated and discarded,
%we use 32 clients to replay the workloads on D-server cluster 
%and measure the \texttt{GET layer} performance as layer restoring performance.
%We use 32 clients.
%Figure~\ref{xxx} shows layer restoring performance changes with different number of D-servers.
%the layer restoring performance compared with the layer \texttt{pulling} performance of original registry
