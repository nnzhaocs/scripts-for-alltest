\subsection{Restoring performance}

In this section, we evaluated D-server cluster's layer restoring performance.
Before we replay traces on the D-server cluster, 
we first warmup the cluster with different amount of layers according to the traces.
After receiving the layers, D-server cluster performs layer deduplication
and save each unique file with three file replicas.
After all warmup layers are deduplicated and discarded,
we replay the traces on D-server cluster 
and measure the \texttt{pull} layer performance as layer restoring performance.
