\section{ Evaluation}
\label{sec:Evaluation}

%Our two-tier heterogeneous cache in the registry can improve the performance of the entire system
%by hiding the long latency imposed by the backend dedup system.
%Next, we present the preliminary evaluation of our user access history-based cache algorithm
%and the space efficiency of file cache.

\subsection{Testbed}

Our testbed includes two clusters: backend registry storage cluster and frontend registry cache cluster. Backend storage cluster includes 12 servers. Each server is equipped with 32 cores, 64 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD and 1 TB HDD. Our frontend cache cluster container 24 servers. Each server is equipped with 8 cores,16 GB RAM and 500 GB SSD. We implemented \sysname~cache on frontend cache cluster and installed \sysname~dedup on backend storage cluster. We use extra 5 machines and each machine launches different number of clients to emulate client requests.
%Hulks and new hulks are used as backend.
%Thors are used as frontend.
\subsection{Workloads and dataset}
We emulated a real-world workloads by combining IBM traces and an image dataset downloaded from Docker Hub.
