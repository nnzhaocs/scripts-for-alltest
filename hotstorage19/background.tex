\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Docker, Docker registry, and Registry backend storage systems}
Docker~\cite{docker} is a popular virtualization technology that extends traditional OS containers with higher level functionalities.
It allows to efficiently package an application and its runtime dependencies in a container image to simplify and automate application deployment~\cite{slacker}.

\input{fig-docker-architecture.tex}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-docker-architecture}, a typical Docker setup consists of three main components: \emph{client}, \emph{host}, and \emph{registry}.
Users interact with Docker using the Docker client which, in turn, sends commands to the Docker host.
The client can be co-located on the host machine. 
The Docker host runs a daemon process that implements the core logic of Docker and is responsible for \emph{running} containers from locally available images.
If a user tries to launch a container from an image that is not available locally, the daemon \emph{pull}s the required image from the Docker registry.
Additionally, the daemon supports \emph{building} new images and \emph{pushing} them to the registry.

The Docker registry is a platform for storing and distributing container images.
It stores images in \emph{repositories}, each containing different versions (\emph{tags}) of the same image, identified as \texttt{<repo-name:tag>}.
For each image, the Docker registry stores a \emph{manifest} that describes, among other things, which layers constitute the image.
The manifest is a JSON file, which contains the runtime configuration for a container image (\eg target platform and environment variables) 
and the list of layers which make up the image.
Layers are identified via a digest that is computed as a hash (SHA-256) over the uncompressed content of the layer and stored as compressed archival files.
Image layers are stored as compressed archival files and image manifests as JSON files.

Docker Hub is one of the most popular public registries, supporting both public and private repositories, via which users can upload, search, and
download images~\cite{docker-hub}.
In Docker Hub, the user repositories are namespaced by user name, i.e., ``$\langle username\rangle/\langle repository name \rangle$", while the
official repositories, which are directly provided by Docker Inc. and partners are called ``$\langle repository name \rangle$".

Modern Docker registry identifies and addresses a layer with a digest that is computed based on the uncompressed layer's content (e.g., SHA-256).
Identifying layers by their content allows the registry to store only one instance of a layer even if it is referenced by multiple images. 
However, if at least one file differs in two otherwise identical layers, the two layers are treated as different and stored separately.

%\paragraph{Images and layers}
At the center of Docker is the concept of container images for packaging, distributing, and running applications.
A Docker image consists of an ordered series of \emph{layers}.
Each Docker layer contains a subset of the files in the image and often represents a specific component/dependency of the image, \eg a shared library.
Layers can be shared between two or more images if the images depend on the same layer.
Image layers are read-only.
When users start a container, Docker creates a new \emph{writable layer} on top of the underlying read-only layers (Figure~\ref{fig-docker-architecture}).
Any changes made to files in the image will be reflected inside the writable layer via a copy-on-write mechanism.
