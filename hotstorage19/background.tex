\section{Background, Observations, and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

Docker~\cite{docker} is a containerization platform to develop, deploy, and run applications inside \emph{containers}.
Users interact with Docker using the Docker client, which in turn sends commands to the Docker host.
The Docker host runs a daemon process that implements the core logic of Docker and is responsible for \emph{running} containers from locally available images.
A Docker image consists of an ordered series of \emph{layers}.
Each Docker layer contains a subset of the files in the image and often represents a specific component/dependency of the image, \eg a shared library.
Layers can be shared between two or more images if the images depend on the same layer.
Image layers are read-only.
When users start a container, Docker creates a new \emph{writable layer} on top of the underlying read-only layers.
% (Figure~\ref{fig-docker-architecture}).
Any changes made to files in the image will be reflected inside the writable layer via a copy-on-write mechanism.

 %in a container image to simplify and automate application deployment~\cite{slacker}.
% for packaging, distributing, and running applications.
%The client can be co-located on the host machine. 
If a user tries to launch a container from an image that is not available locally, the daemon \texttt{pulls} the required image from the Docker registry.
Additionally, the daemon supports \texttt{building} new images and \texttt{pushing} them to the registry.

\subsection{Docker registry and backend cloud storage systems}
Docker registry~\cite{docker-hub} is a platform for storing and distributing container images.
It stores images in \emph{repositories}, each containing different versions (\emph{tags}) of the same image, identified as \texttt{<repo-name:tag>}.
For each image, the Docker registry stores a \emph{manifest} that describes, among other things, which layers constitute the image.
%The manifest is a JSON file, which contains the runtime configuration for a container image (\eg target platform and environment variables) 
%and the list of layers which make up the image.
Layers are identified via a digest that is computed as a hash (SHA-256) over the uncompressed content of the layer and stored as compressed archival files.
%By using layer-level content addressable store, 
%Image layers are stored as compressed archival files and image manifests as JSON files.

%Docker registry is a web server that serves docker pull and docker push requests.
Although Docker registry is a layer-level content addressable storage system storing all the images,
it delegates storage to drivers that interact with either a local file system or a remote cloud storage such as Amazon S3~\cite{s3}, Microsoft Azure~\cite{azure}, OpenStack Swift~\cite{swift}, and Aliyun OSS~\cite{aliyun}. 
For example, Google Container Registry~\cite{GoogleContainerRegistry} uses Google cloud 
as its backend image store.
Users \texttt{push} and \texttt{pull} Docker images to and from their repositories that are stored on cloud storage. As pointed out in ~\cref{sec:intro}, service providers often use geographically distributed registries for faster access, e.g., IBM's Container Registry setup spans five regions~\cite{dockerworkload}. 

%\input{fig-docker-architecture.tex}
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig-docker-architecture}, a typical Docker setup consists of three main components: \emph{client}, \emph{host}, and \emph{registry}.
%Docker Hub is one of the most popular public registries, supporting both public and private repositories, via which users can upload, search, and
%download images.
%In Docker Hub, the user repositories are namespaced by user name, i.e., ``$\langle username\rangle/\langle repository name \rangle$", while the
%official repositories, which are directly provided by Docker Inc. and partners are called ``$\langle repository name \rangle$".
%Most existing cloud storage providers employ data deduplication techniques to eliminate redundant data, same data stored more than once. 
%Deduplication techniques significantly reduce storage needs and therefore reduce storage costs and improve storage efficiency. 
%Data deduplication works by storing duplicate data chunks only once, keeping only the unique data chunks. 
%Current cloud providers deploy a cross-user client-side fixed-size-chunk-level data deduplication that delivers the highest deduplication gain~\cite{pooranian2018rare}. 
%These approaches maximize the benefit of deduplication: 
%The cross-user data deduplication treats cloud storage as a pool shared by all the cloud users, because the potential for 
%data deduplication is the highest as the probability for redundancies and duplicates is higher the more inclusive the shared pool. 
%The fixed-size-chunk-level specifies that a fixed-size chunk is the unit for checking for duplicates on cloud storage.
%Google cloud and AWS employ StorReduce, a deduplication software that performs in-line data deduplication transparently and resides between the client's application and the hosting cloud storage. StorReduce provide 80-97\% storage and bandwidth reduction to the cloud providers~\cite{StorReduce_google}.
