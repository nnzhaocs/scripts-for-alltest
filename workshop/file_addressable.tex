\section{Rethinking storage for Docker registry}
\label{sec:file_adressable}
\NZ{The main goal of this section is to provide some hints for designer to implement a fast dedup system.
	We do not give any design in the workshop paper. We will keep performance analysis and simulation part, 
	just give some basic latencies for each involved operations for designer to think about how to improve their design and what will be the bottleneck.

In this section, as an alternative to layer-level content addressable storage,
a file-level content addressable storage model (FLCAS) is suggested for Docker
registry to remove redundant files. % and save space while maintaing good
FLCAS, can significantly reduce the redundant files in docker registry and save
a large volume of storage space. However, FLCAS may also introduce considerable
overheads, which include compressions/decompression of layer archival files,
calculation of file content digest, searching for identical files, etc. In this
section, we explain how FLCAS supports \emph{push layer} and \emph{pull layer}
requests. We also
provide different suggestions on how Docker registry can mitigate
the affects of such overheads and efficiently server push/pull requests. We
also simulated FLCAS on 0.9 million layers and provided performance analysis.

\subsection{File-level content addressable storage model (FLCAS)}
For all the \emph{push layer} requests, file-level deduplication mainly
consists of three steps: layer decompression, file content digest calculation,
and searching \& indexing. The unique files are stored in a \textit{file pool}
and redundant copies are removed. 
%\alicomment{How are we saving the location
%of each file in the layer? It is not clear from the following sentences.}
%\NZ{addressed}
For each file in a layer, \textit{file content address} is recorded, which is a
file digest linked to the files' location.  Also for all layers, layer digest
to its containing file content digest mapping record is also created and saved
to a \textit{layer-to-file table}. The \textit{layer-to-file table} also
records the file path within each layer associated with each file.
%\alicomment{Separately mention pull layer requests}

For all the \emph{pull layer} requests, Docker registry will first fetch 
all its containing files by consulting the \textit{layer-to-file table} and 
create a layer archive file by compressing these files, 
then send the compressed layer archive file to the clients.

\paragraph{Deduplicating when workload is light}
Deduplication can be expensive in terms of performance overhead. However
according to IBM container registry workload analysis~\cite{dockerworkload},
workload fluctuates, with peaks and troughs~\cite{dockerworkload}. Also, 80\%
of the time, registry serves only 100 or less requests. So file-level
dedupilication can be triggered for removing the redundant files for cold
layers only when the workload is low and storage utilization is high.  To
further improve the performance of FLCAS, we also suggest to use main memory
for temporarily storing and processing \textit{small} layers. According to our
findings, majority (87.3\%) of layers are smaller than 50~MB as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:layer-size-cdf} So majority of layers can be stored and
processed in RAM to speed up file-level dedup.

	\caption{CDF of layer \& image pull count.
	}
	\label{fig:pull-cnt}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Caching hot layers}
To reduce overhead, we suggest caching the hot/recently requested layers as
gzip compressed tar files. We observed that only a small proportion of images
and layers are frequently requested and majority of images and layers are
\textit{cold}. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pull-cnt}, x-axis shows the total
number of pulls since the layers/images are stored in Docker Hub to May 30,
2017.  We see that only 20\% and 10\% of images are pulled more that 100 and
360 times respectively.  Similarly, only 20\% and 10\% of layers are pulled
more that 217 and 660 times.  Note that the layers'pull count shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pull-cnt} is calculated by aggregating all the images'pull
counts that refers this layer.  Note that the image pull counts are crawled
from Docker Hub website.  Actual layer pull count should be less than the
number shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pull-cnt} because pulling a image does not
necessarily pull all its containing layers as we don't pull the layers if they
have already been downloaded.

\subsection{Performance analysis}

%
% since dedup process only starts periodically when the
%workload is lower and only cold layers are evolved in dedup process (discussed
%in Section~\ref{subsec:FLCAS}).
%
%\lrcomment{By latency, do you mean the time it takes to perform the dedup? I
%wouldn't call that latency but rather run time or completion time.}
%
%\lrcomment{What exactly was the setup? Where those 60 requests submitted while
%the dedup was running and where they submitted only once or repeatedly?}

We wrote around 600 lines of Python code to perform file-level deduplication
operations on the layer dataset, specially, we read a layer from layer dataset
to a RAM disk (i.e., tmpfs) and then decompresses it. 
%
Then we
calculate each containing files' digests and append the layer-to-file digest
mapping records to a mapping table. 
%
Only unique files are maintained in RAM
disk while the redundant copies are removed.

To quantify the run time to perform file-level deduplication, we setup a
one-node Docker registry with 64~GB RAM and 32 Cores.  
%
We performed
deduplication of 60 concurrent layers for 0.9 Million layers in total.
%To improve searching performance, the
%mapping table is stored in Hive database~\cite{xxx}. 
%
%\lrcomment{Why are we using Hive for this? It seems overkill to me, especially
%for such small data. Even at scale, a KeyValue store would probably provide
%better performance than clunky MapReduce-based DB.}
%
Note that the latency of \emph{push layer} requests is not influenced by the
file-level deduplication because registry initialy stores a copy of layer as it is
and sends a response message to the user. 
%
No addition delay will be added to the pushing time. 
%
However, compression time will impact the latency for \emph{pull layer} requests
since the files need to be packed and compressed first and then sent to the
users once registry receives pulling requests to the cold layers. 
%
Similar to deduplication, to generate \emph{pull layer}
requests, we randomly request 60 different layers in pralallel for 0.9 Million
layers. 
%
For \emph{pull layer} requests, we pack and compresses the layer's containing
files by searching the mapping table for the layer digest. 

\paragraph{File-level deduplication run time}

%and pulling requests for  
%
Figure~\ref{fig:dedup-res} shows the breakdown of run time for each
involved operation: decompression time, unpacking time, file content digest
calculation time, and searching time.

First, among all the operations, we see that searching time is the
smallest. 
%
80\% of searching time is less than 0.004 s. 
%
The mapping table
maintains 0.98 million layer-to-file digest mapping records. 
%
Consider that more
than 1.7 million layers are stored in Docker hub and the number is still
increasing, it's better to choose a fast distributed database to provide high
searching performance and scalability.
%
%\lrcomment{How does our DB schema look and what are the search queries?}
  
Second, we see that digest calculation time spreads over a large range started
from 0.000005 s to 124.7 s. 
%
It's because digest calculation time largely
depends on the layer size. 
%
Typically, smaller layers contains a smaller number
of smaller files, which takes much less time to calculate their digests. 
%
While
if the layer is bigger, the digest calculation overhead will be higher. 
%
80\% of
digest calculation time is less than 4.21 s. 
%
Thus, we suggest that multiple-threading is needed to calculate the files'
digests simultaneously; 
%
Fast CPUs as well as more powerful computing nodes are
required to speed up digest calculation.

Third, the run time for decompression and unpacking have the same distribution
during the lowest response time range started from 0.04 s to 0.15 s. 
%
Around
60\% of decompression and unpacking time are less than 0.15 s. 
%
However,
decompression has the highest time than that of unpacking. 
%
80\% of
decompression is less than 0.55 s while 80\% of packing time is less than 0.21 s. 

Figure~\ref{fig:dedup-res} also shows the total time distribution for
file-level deduplication which is the sum of run time for decompression, unpacking,
digest calculation, and searching. 
%
We see that 80\% of file-level dedup time is
less than 9.09 s per layer.
%
%\lrcomment{Is that per layer or per file or per image?}
%
We also measured the throughput of 60 processes. 
%
Our one-node file-level
deduplication prototype can process about 3 layers/s. 
%
We suggest to use more
high powerful machines to improve throughput.

\paragraph{\emph{Pull layer} latency} Figure~\ref{fig:dedup-res} shows the \emph{pull layer} latency
distribution. 
%
Note that the \emph{pull layer} latency is the sum of archiving time,
compression time, and searching time and does not include network transfer
time. 
%
We can see that compression and archiving time almost share the same
distribution during the lowest response time range started from 0.04 s to 0.15
s. 60\% of compression and archiving time are less than 0.15 s.
%
While
compression has the highest run time. 
%
80\% of compression time is less than 2.82~s. 
%
We see that archiving time and compression contributes equally to pulling
latency when their run time are lower than 0.15 s while compression time almost
equals to pulling latency when the compression time is greater than 0.15 s. 
%
Hence, we
suggest that fast compression methods are required to reduce compression time.

%discussion of pull counts does not really justify read (pull) cache.  For the
%read (pull) cache to be efficient there should be many pulls that access the
%same layers. E.g., that XXX\% of pulls go to the few YYY popular layers.

%\subsection{Using RAM to load \&. process layers}
%
%To improve performance, we use RAM to temporarily store \textit{small} layers
%and directly process them in RAM.  Specially, we first load small layers in a
%RAM disk and perform decompression, unpacking, file content digest calculation
%in RAM, and remove them from RAM after completion.   According to our findings
%that majority (87.3\%) of layers that are less than 50M as shown in
%Figure~\ref{fig:image-layer-size}. So majority of layers can be stored and
%processed in RAM to speed up file-level dedup. 
%%layers that are less than 50M are stored and processed in RAM while the rest
%%layers are stored and processed in SSDs.

%%
%\lrcomment{How are small layers defined? Where is the threshold?}
%
%majority (xxx) of layers'dedup times are less than xxx.
%during peak workload, which means that we start file-level dedup whenever it receives a layer. 
%To simulate the high intensive workload, we first sent a sequential of layer pushing requests to registry and stored, then we measure the file-level dedup  
%, archiving time, and compression time.
%Second, compare the latency for each operation, we see that xxxx
