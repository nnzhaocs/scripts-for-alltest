%\subsection{Overview of file duplicates}
%\paragraph{File repeat count}

%The first step of our deduplication analysis is to calculate the file repeat
%count based on the file digests. Then we calculated the deduplication ratio
%using the savings after elimiation of file duplicates in terms of file count
%and capacity.

\paragraph{Layer reference count}

\input{fig-layer-ref-cnt}

An interesting question is what is the sharing rate of layers across images.
This will tell us how efficiently layer-level content addressable store is utilized by Docker registry 
and how much space is saved currently by layer-level content addressable store
%
We analyze all image manifests and count for each layer, how many times it is
referenced by an image.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:ref_count} shows that around 90\% of layers are only reference
by a single image while 95\% are reference by not more than 2 images.
%
Similarly, 99\% of layers are shared among less than 25 images. 
%
Accordingly, we calculated the redundant ratio achieved by layer CAS which is xxx.
%Figure~\ref{} shows the absolute values, revealing that almost 1.5 million
%images are only referenced once.  \acomment{Figure is missing} While there is
%again a large spectrum of reference counts, the maximum is 33,428, the vast
%majority of layers is not shared. 
%
This hints that the layer-based approach to improve storage efficiency is
barely utilized and there is room for improvement in how to construct more
sharable layers.
%
\emph{These findings reveal that layer level CAS has not been very successful
	and most of the layers that exists in Docker Hub are not shared among images.
	%
	Hence, there is a dire need of a better redundancy management.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:file-repeat-cnt} shows the cumulative and probability
distribution of file repeat count.  \textit{We see that majority of files have
more than one copies (99.42\%).  Most files have a small repeat count.} For
instance, almost 90\% of files have equal or less than 10 copies. Around 50\%
of files have 4 copies.  The file that has the maximum repeat count is an empty
file, which means that many users create and store empty files in their
images.

\paragraph{Deduplication ratio}
%As discussed in compression ratio analysis, we see that there is redundant
%data in both layers and images.  We conducted simple form of deduplication to
%Interestingly,
Next, we calculate deduplication ratio in terms of file count and capacity for
the complete uncompressed dataset (Table~\ref{tbl:overall-redundant_ratio}).
%the redundant file overhead of the uncompressed dataset 
We find that majority of the files have more than one copy (99.42\%), which
take up over 89\% of capacity.
After elimination of file duplicates, the
percentage of such files decrease from 99.42\% to 2.59\%. 
Overall, only 3.17\% (23.92 TB) of files are unique files while 96.83\% of files 
(143.28 TB) are redundant copies. Correspondingly, the deduplication ratio is 96.83\%
and 85.69\% in terms of file count and capacity, respectively.
% Table~\ref{tbl:overall-redundant_ratio} summaries the overall redundant file
% overhead in terms of file count and capacity.

\textit{Finding 1: Majority of files in Docker registry are
duplicates which occupy most of capacity, indicating that Docker Hub has severe
redundancy problem.}

%Based on the high deduplication ratio, we guess that a large amount of files are shared between layers and the large potential from deduplication is due to files sharing between layers. Cross layer shared files are files that stored in more than one layers. There could be a high probability for Docker registry. For example, different developers work on same source codes and build same executables in their layers. Now, we calculated the percentage of cross layer shared files for each layer as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:layer-dedup-ratio}.

%%The analysis of compression ratio shows plenty redundant data exist in individual layers. 
%%
%%We define two duplicate ratio for layers: intra-layer duplicate ratio and inter-layer duplicate ratio. Intra-layer duplicate ratio $r_{intra\_ldedup.}$ is calculated as:
%%$r_{intra\_ldedup.} = \frac{S_{un.\_l} - S_{un.\_ldedup.}}{S_{un.\_l}}$, where $S_{un.\_l}$ is the uncompressed layer size while $S_{un.\_ldedup.}$ is the uncompressed layer size after removing the intra-layer duplicate files. Inter-layer duplicate ratio $r_{inter\_ldedup.}$ is calculated as:
%%$r_{inter\_ldedup.} = \frac{S_{un.\_l} - S_{un.\_sldedup.}}{S_{un.\_l}}$, where $S_{un.\_l}$ is the uncompressed layer size while $S_{un.\_sldedup.}$ is the uncompressed layer size after removing the inter-layer duplicate files.

%While 0.3 M of images contains 95\% of the inter-image duplicate files. We also manually inspect few of these layers that found xxx.

%Interestingly, we fond that considerable duplicate files are stored across the layers referred by the same images.

%, indicating that majority of files are replicated across different layers and plenty of redundant files are replicated within each layer.
%Figure~\ref{fig:layer-dedup_hist} shows that 1.1 M of layers contains 45\% of the intra-layer duplicate files. We manually inspect few of these layers and found xxxx.
%While 1.5 M of layers contains 95\% of the inter-layer duplicate files. We also manually inspect few of these layers that found xxx.

%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:layer-dedup-ratio}, the differences between  duplicate ratio in terms of file count and  duplicate ratio in terms of capacity are very small, meaning that there is no huge difference among the sizes of duplicate files.
