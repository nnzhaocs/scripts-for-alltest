\section{Deduplication analysis}
\label{sec:redundant_files}

In this section, we investigate the potential for data deduplication in Docker
registry.
%
Docker, in its current state, already performs rudimentary deduplication by
sharing identical layers between images. 
%
We start our analysis from quantifying how much benefits does this existing
approach provides.
%
However, we believe that there is significantly more potential in deduplicating
individual files in the layers.
%
We, therefore, estimate the efficacy of file-level deduplication and analyze
the root causes of high high redundancy.
