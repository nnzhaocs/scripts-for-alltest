\section{Deduplication analysis}
\label{sec:redundant_files}

In this section, we investigate the potential for data deduplication in Docker
registry.
%
Since, layers are stored in gzip compressed format, 
we decompressed and unpacked all the layers, and conduct
deduplication analysis on the uncompressed dataset.
%
\VT{Not sure what you mean by ``layers are not duplicated''. Rephrase or
clarify.}
%
We investigate the efficacy of File-level deduplication for Docker registry.
%
\VT{Why ``also''? What else do we do?}\NZ{addressed all above comments}

File-level deduplication eliminates files whose full content is a duplicate of
another file.
%
To identify full file duplicates in our dataset, we calculated each file's
digest using MD5 hash algorithm~\cite{MD5} and present file-level deduplication
analysis results.
