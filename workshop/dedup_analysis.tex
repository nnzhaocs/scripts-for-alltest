\section{Deduplication analysis}
\label{sec:redundant_files}
%\NZ{I would like to add some general analysis before dedup analysis.}
In this section, we investigate the potential for data deduplication in the
Docker registry.
%
We first analyze the benefits of data reduction
techniques that Docker already implements---layer sharing and local
compression.
%
%\LR{We should introduce the term layer-level deduplication in the previous
%section.}
%
%\VT{Lukas, I rephrased and changed to layer sharing, which was introduced in
%prev. section. c if it reads better now.}
%\NZ{changed to layer-sharing.}
%
%Docker, in its current state, already performs rudimentary deduplication by
%sharing identical layers between images.
%
%We start our analysis from quantifying how much benefits does this existing
%approach provides.
%
%However, we believe that there is significantly more potential in
%deduplicating individual files in the layers.
%
We then use the same dataset to estimate the efficacy of file-level
deduplication and analyze the root causes of the high file redundancy found
across container images.
