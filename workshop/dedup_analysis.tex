\section{Deduplication analysis}
\label{sec:redundant_files}

In this section, we investigate the potential for data deduplication in
the Docker registry.
%
Therefor, we download a large set of images from the Docker Hub
registry~\cite{docker-hub} and analyze the benefits of the current layer-level
deduplication approach.
%
\LR{We should introduce the term layer-level deduplication in the previous section.}
%
%Docker, in its current state, already performs rudimentary deduplication by
%sharing identical layers between images.
%
%We start our analysis from quantifying how much benefits does this existing
%approach provides.
%
%However, we believe that there is significantly more potential in deduplicating
%individual files in the layers.
%
We then use the same dataset to estimate the efficacy of file-level deduplication
and analyze the root causes of the high file redundancy found across container
images.
