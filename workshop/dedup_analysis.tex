\section{Deduplication analysis}
\label{sec:redundant_files}

In this section, we investigate the potential for data deduplication in Docker
registry.
%
Since, layers are stored in gzip compressed format and layers are not
duplicated, we decompressed and unpacked all the layers, and conduct
deduplication analysis on the uncompressed dataset.
%
We also investigate the efficacy of File-level deduplication.

File-level deduplication is a simple and efficient content-based deduplication
strategy, which can eliminate files whose full content is a duplicate of
another file.
%
To find out how many full file duplicates in the dataset, we calculated a
digest of the complete file by using MD5 hash algorithm~\cite{MD5} and presents
file-level deduplication analysis results.
