\section{Registry with deduplication support}
\label{sec:file_adressable}

%Our analysis in Section~\ref{sec:redundant_files} suggests that adding the
%support of file-level deduplication to Docker registry can significantly reduce
%its storage capacity requirements, especially in large-scale deployments.
%
In this section, we first describe a high-level design of \emph{\sysname}---
Docker registry that supports file-level deduplication.
We then proceed with a simulation-based evaluation of the expected performance
degradation.
