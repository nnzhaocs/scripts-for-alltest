\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Data deduplication has proved itself as a highly effective technique for
eliminating data redundancy.
%
In spite of being successfully applied to numerous real datasets, deduplication
bypassed such a promising area as Docker images.
%
In this paper, we start to fix this striking omission.
%
We analyzed over 1.7 million real-world Docker layers and identified that
file-level deduplication can eliminate 96.8\% of the files resulting in
capacity-wise deduplication ratio of 6.9$\times$.
%
We proceeded with a simulation-based evaluation of the impact of deduplication
on Docker registry performance.
%
We found that restoring large layers from registry would slow down the pull performance due to compression overhead. To speed up Simmer, we propose several optimizations.
%
%\VT{After Section 4 is ready, we might add here one interesting finding from
%simulation.}\NZ{addressed}
%
Our findings justify and lay way for integrating deduplication in Docker
registry.

%\paragraph{Future work}
%%
%In future we plan to investigate the effectiveness of sub-file deduplication of
%Docker images.
%%
%We also want to extend our analysis to the images tagged other than with the
%\emph{latest} tag.
%%
%Finally, we plan to proceed with complete implementation of deduplication in
%Docker registry.
