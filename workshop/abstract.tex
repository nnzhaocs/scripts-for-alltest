Due to their tight isolation, low overhead, and efficient packaging of the
execution environment, Docker containers have become a prominent solution for
deploying modern applications.
%
Containers are created from \emph{images} which are stored in a Docker \emph{registry}.
%
An image consists of a list of \emph{layers} which can be shared among images.
%
Docker registries store a large amount of images and with the increasing
popularity of Docker, they continue to grow. For example, Docker Hub---a
popular public registry---stores more than half a million public images.
%
In this paper, we analyze over 167\,TB of uncompressed Docker images and evaluate
the potential of file-level deduplication in the Docker registry.
%
Our analysis reveals that only~3\% of the files in images are unique
and existing layer sharing mechanism is not sufficient to eliminate this
profound redundancy.
%
We then present the design of \sysname---a Docker registry with deduplication
support---and conduct a simulation-based analysis of its performance implications.
