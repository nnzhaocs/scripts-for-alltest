Due to their tight isolation, low overhead, and efficient packaging of the
execution environment, Docker containers have become a prominent solution for
deploying modern applications.
%
Containers are created from images which are stored in a Docker registry.
%
An image consists of a list of layers which can be shared among images.
%
Docker registries store a large amount of images and with the increasing
popularity of Docker, they continue to grow. For example, Docker Hub---a
popular public registry---stores more than half a million public images.
%
In this paper, we analyze over 167TB of uncompressed Docker images and evaluate
the potential of file-level deduplication in the Docker registry.
%
Our analysis reveals that only~3\% of the files in unpacked images are unique.
%
Existing layer sharing mechanism is not capable of eliminating this massive
data redundancy.
%
We then present the design of \sysname---Docker registry with deduplication
support---and conduct simulation-based analysis of performance implications.
