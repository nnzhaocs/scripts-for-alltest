\subsection{Images}
\label{sec:images}

We continue analyzing images and present the following useful metric distributions: image size and compressibility, layer reference count, file and directory
counts. 

\paragraph{Image size}%{Layer and image size}

%Conatiner image size determines the runtime of container if it is not already
%cached locally. 
Similar to layers, we measured compressed and uncompressed image size. 
Figure~\ref{fig:image-size-cdf} show the image size distributions. 
%and a finer resolution only covering images smaller than 1.5 GB.
%\acomment{Could not locate the figures you are talking about. I see two figures
%layers size and image size.}
We find that 80\% of the images have an uncompressed size less than
794 MB and compressed size of 312 MB.
%while compressed images are less than 0.48 GB. 
In the median, this decreases to 406 MB and 157 MB, respectively. The largest
uncompressed image is 498 GB which is a Ubuntu-based image.  

\emph{Figure~\ref{fig:image-size-cdf} shows that the majority of uncompressed images in
Docker Hub are small which aligns with the Docker philosophy to package
software and distribute software in containers but include only its necessary
dependencies.}

\paragraph{Compression ratio}

%Figure~\ref{fig:compress-ratio} shows the compression ratio of the container

To further study the sizes and the impact of compression, we calculate the
compression ratios for images (see Figure~\ref{fig:compress-ratio}).
80\% of images have compression ratio less than 2.9 while the median is 2.6. 
\textit{We see that majority of images have a compression ratio within 2-3.}
Compare with compression ratio for layers, we see that images have a much smaller
compression ratio. 
\textit{This means that images contains both layers with high compression ratio and low compression ratio.}
%, which means images contains different layers and high . 

%\acomment{Found following para in directory count subsection..}
%
%The ALS-to-CLS ratio is generally greater than the FLS-to-CLS ratio because
%small files in layers get larger when combined in a tar archive.
%
%90\% of layers have a  compression ratio less than 4 and the median compression
%ratio is 2.6. The largest compression ratio is 1026.
%%
%Half of the layers have a compression ratio around 3.
%
%
%The maximum FLS-to-CLS is 512,930 and maximum ALS-to-CLS is 1026.
%
%Looking at the histogram (see Figure~\ref{}), we see
%that around 600,000 layers have a compression ratio of between 2 and 3 while
%more than 300,000 between 1 and 2.
%
%Two peaks in the graph correspond to 587,000 layers that have the FLS-to-CLS
%ratio of 3 and 331,000 layers that have the ALS-to-CLS ratio of 3.

\paragraph{Layer count per image}
%\nancomment{more layer more matedata? overhead for union fs}

\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\subfigure[CDF of layer count]{\label{fig:layer_count}
		\includegraphics[width=0.215\textwidth]{graphs/image-layer-cnt}%

\end{figure}

As discussed in~\ref{sec:layers}, images consist of a set of layers.
It is important to understand the layer count of the images as previous
work found that the number of layers can impact the performance of
I/O operations~\cite{slacker}. Therefore, we count the number of layers
per image and plot the CDF (see Figure~\ref{fig:layer_count})
and layer count frequencies (see Figure~\ref{fig:hist_layer_count})for all
Docker Hub images.

The results show that 90\% of the images have less than 26 layers while
half of the images have less than 10 layers. 11 layers is also the most
frequent layer value with 34,420 images consisting of exactly 11 layers.
The maximum layer count is 120 in the \textit{cfgarden/120-layer-image}.
We also find that there are 4,792 images which only consist of a single layer.

\emph{As a rule of thumb, less number of layers is better for the union file
	system as it then needs to handle less metadata. However, as a tradeoff,
	reducing the number of layers significantly effects the data sharing among images.
	%As a result, we see less number of layers shared among different images.
	For an example, if a image consists of only single layer its data can not be shared
	with other images.}
%\input{fig-repeat-layer-cnt.tex}

%\paragraph{Repeat layer count distribution}
\paragraph{Layer reference count}
%\nancomment{should create more shared layers to remove duplicates}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.21\textwidth]{graphs/shared-cnt-cdf.pdf}
	\caption{CDF of layer reference count.
	}
	\label{fig:ref_count}
\end{figure}

An interesting question is what is the sharing rate of layers across images.
We analyze all image manifests and count for each layer, how many times it is
referenced by an image. Figure~\ref{fig:ref_count} shows that around 90\% of
layers are only reference by a single image while 95\% are reference by not
more than 2 images. Similarly, 99\% of layers are shared among less than 25
images. 
%Figure~\ref{} shows the absolute values, revealing that
%almost 1.5 million images are only referenced once.  \acomment{Figure is
%	missing} While there is again a large spectrum of reference counts, the maximum
%is 33,428, the vast majority of layers is not shared. 
This hints that the
layer-based approach to improve storage efficiency is barely utilized and there
is room for improvement in how to construct more sharable layers.

\emph{These findings reveal that layer level CAS has not been very successful
	and most of the layers that exists in Docker Hub are not shared among images.
	Hence, there is a dire need of a better redundancy management.}

\paragraph{Directory count and File count}

Next, we look at the directory (Figure~\ref{fig:dir-cnt-cdf}) and file count
(Figure~\ref{fig:file-cnt-cdf}) in images to determine if deploying images requires
handling of large amounts of metadata. 
Looking at directories, we see that 50\% of images have less than 3,326 directories and 90\% of images have less than
9,692 directories. %70\% of images have more than 2,500 directories. 
For
files, 50\% of images have less than 27,194 files and 90\% of images have less than 74,266 files.

This is consistent with our analysis of layer-based file and directory counts
and the number of layers per image. Again, \textit{we conclude that most images do not
require an extensive amount of metadata when being deployed as file and
directory counts are low except for few outliers.}
