%Based on the second-and third-level classification, we investigated the following two research questions: (1) What are the common redundant files?
%(2) Why there are so many redundant files? and present our investigation results.

In this section, we investigate how many duplicate files are in layers, images, and registry in term of file count and capacity and present the results.
