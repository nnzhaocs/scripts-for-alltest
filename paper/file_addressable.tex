\section{Rethinking storage model for Docker registry}
\label{sec:file_adressable}

%\subsection{}
%\paragraph{Benefit of file-level content addressable storage}
Currently, Docker registry uses layer-level content addressable storage model to avoid storing redundant copies of an identical layer. 
However, as discussed in previous sections, almost 97\% files are redundant files which accounts for 86\% of storage space (uncompressed). 
As the number of images stored in Docker registry is increasing dramatically, 
storing and managing the large proportion of redundant files requires both storage equipment and administration investment. 

In this section, a file-level content addressable storage model is suggested for Docker registry to remove redundant files and save space.   
%Docker registry can save a lot of space if using file-level content addressable storage. 
%Benefit: saving money, reducing storage management overhead.

\subsection{File-level content addressable storage model (FLCAS)}
\label{subsec:FLCAS}

\end{figure}

File-level content addressable storage system (FLCAS) uses file-level dedup to remove the redundant copies of an identical file by generating a digest (such as MD5 or SHA256) from the file it refers to. FLCAS exposes a high-level layer addressing by mapping their digests to their containing file digests.     
 %a digest generated by a cryptographic hash function (such as ) 

%\subsection{Trade-off discussion}
File-level dedup can significantly reduce the redundant files in docker registry and save a large volume of storage space. However, it also introduces considerable overhead, which including layer decompression, file content digest calculation, indexing, and layer compression overhead. These additional operations are either CPU intensive or I/O intensive.

	}
	\label{fig:pull-cnt}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Caching hot layers}To reduce overhead, we temporarily cache the hot/recently requested layers as gzip compressed tarball in a \textit{layer cache pool} without file-level dedup.
We observed that only a small proportion of images and layers are frequently requested. A majority of images and layers are \textit{cold}.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pull-cnt}, x-axis shows the total number of pullings since the layers/images are stored in Docker Hub to May 30, 2017. 
We see that only 20\% and 10\% of images are pulled more that 100 and 1000 times respectively. 
Similarly, only 20\% and 10\% of layers are pulled more that xxx and xxxx times. 
Note that 
the layers'pull count shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pull-cnt} is calculated by aggregating all the images'pull counts that refers this layer. 
Actual layer pull count should be less than the number shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pull-cnt} because pulling a image does not necessarily pull all its containing layers as we don't pull the layers if they have already been downloaded.
 
\paragraph{Dedup when workload is light}Consider that dedup is expensive in terms of performance overhead, file-level dedup is only triggered for removing the redundant files for cold layers when the workload is lower than a predefined threshold $\sigma_{wl}$ and storage utilization is higher than a predefined threshold $\sigma_{su}$. 
Typically, workload fluctuates, with peaks and troughs. According to IBM bluemix workload analysis\cite{xxx}, xxx of time, there were only xxx requests. %During high intensive load, 
Thus, file-level dedup runs periodically to reduce redundant files without causing performance overhead. 

%high while start file-level dedup 
\paragraph{FLCAS model}
Figure~\ref{fig:file-dedup-model} shows an example of FLCAS. The recently pushed layers are treated as hot layers and cached in layer cache pool. 
All the pulling requests to these hot layers are served from layer cache pool.
When the workload is lower than $\sigma_{wl}$ and storage utilization is higher than $\sigma_{su}$, file-level dedup is triggered. 
File-level dedup mainly contains three steps: layer decompression, file content digest calculation, and searching \&. indexing.
During file-level dedup, the unique files are stored in a \textit{file pool} and redundant copies are removed.  
A unique \textit{file content address} is recorded, which is a
file digest uniquely and linked to the files'location.
Meanwhile, a layer digest to its containing file content digest mapping record is also created and saved to a \textit{layer-to-file digest table}. 
 All the pulling request to the cold layers are served by file pool via searching for the layer digest from layer-to-file digest mapping table. After fetching all the containing files that are required by requested layer, FLCAS compresses these files as gzip file before sending it to Docker clients.         

\subsection{Off-line file-level dedup latency} 

Since file-level dedup involves operations that are either CPU intensive or I/O intensive, fast CPUs and high capacity RAM are required to improve performance.

\paragraph{Using RAM to load \&. process layers}

To improve performance, we use RAM to temporarily store \textit{small} layers and directly process them in RAM.
Specially, we first load small layers in RAM and perform decompression, unpacking, file content digest calculation in RAM, and remove them from RAM after completion.   
According to our findings that majority (87.3\%) of layers that are less than 50M as shown in Figure~\ref{xxx}. So majority of layers can be stored and processed in RAM to speed up file-level dedup. 
%layers that are less than 50M are stored and processed in RAM while the rest layers are stored and processed in SSDs.

	\label{fig:dedup-res}
\end{figure}

%\paragraph{Image \&. layer popularity skewness} 
To quantify the overhead of file-level dedup, we simulated a one-node docker registry with 64 RAM and 32 Cores with 60 concurrent pulling requests to cold layers since dedup process only starts periodically when the workload is lower and only cold layers are evolved in dedup process (discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:FLCAS}).
We measured its performance by using file-level dedup for 0.89 million small layers. 
To speed up dedup process, we leverage multi-processing.

Figure~\ref{fig:dedup-res} shows the breakdown latencies: decompression time, unpacking time, file content digest calculation time, archiving time, and compression time.

Second,

Figure~\ref{fig:dedup-res} also shows the total time for 
%majority (xxx) of layers'dedup times are less than xxx.
%during peak workload, which means that we start file-level dedup whenever it receives a layer. 
%To simulate the high intensive workload, we first sent a sequential of layer pushing requests to registry and stored, then we measure the file-level dedup  
The throughput is 2.67 layers/s.

\paragraph{Compression overhead discussion for pulling}
Note that the pushing performance are not influenced by the file-level dedup because once the layer reaches registry, an response message will be sent to the user. No addition delay will be added to the pushing time. However, compression time will impact pulling performance since the files need to be compressed first and then sent to the users once registry receives pulling requests.  

%Second, compare the latency for each operation, we see that xxxx

%We calculated the latency for each operation for all layers as shown as Table~\ref{tbl:latency_breakdown}.

%\paragraph{Smaller number of layers are shared among different images}

%
%\paragraph{Smaller pull latency than recompression model} the registry can prepare the reconstructed layers before users issue a pull request. But this model requires users to rebuild two layers.
