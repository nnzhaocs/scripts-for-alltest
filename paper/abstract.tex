\subsection*{Abstract}

Docker containers are becoming increasingly popular due to their isolation
properties, low overhead, and efficient packaging of execution environment.
Containers are created from images which preserve software dependencies,
environment configuration, and other parameters that affect application's
runtime. Docker registry stores images and allows clients to push images to and
pull images from it. The total amount of images stored in Docker Hub registry
is 457,627 now and is continuing to increase. As the amount of images stored in
public and private Docker registries increases it becomes important to
study images' characteristics. Such knowledge can help to improve storage
performance both at Docker registry and Docker client sides.

Our goal is to collect statistics from a large amount of Docker images and
perform a large-scale characterization of Docker images. So far, we downloaded
143,784 images from Docker Hub registry (20TB, 31\% of the whole dataset) and
performed the first in-depth analysis for these images. We characterize images
using multiple metrics, e.g., image size distribution, file size and type
distribution, the number of layers per image, the amount of redundant data
between images and layers, temporal trends.
