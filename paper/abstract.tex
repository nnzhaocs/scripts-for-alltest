Docker containers are becoming increasingly popular due to their isolation
properties, low overhead, and efficient packaging of execution environment.
%
Containers are created from images which preserve software dependencies,
environment configuration, and other parameters that affect application's
runtime.
%
Docker registry stores images and allows users to exchange them
between each other.
%
The amount of data Docker registries store is massive; Docker Hub,
for instance, stores at least half million public images.
%
%As the amount of images stored in public and private Docker registries
%increases it becomes important to study images' characteristics.
%
%
We utilize this massive dataset to study data-centric properties 
of containerized applications.
%
%Our goal is to collect statistics from a large amount of Docker images and
%perform a large-scale characterization of Docker images.
%
We downloaded over 50TB of images from Docker Hub
and performed the first in-depth analysis of these images.
%
We characterize images using multiple metrics, e.g., image size distribution,
file size and type distribution, the number of layers per image, the amount of
redundant data between images and layers.
%
Our findings can help to make conscious decisions
when designing storage for containers and Docker in particular.
