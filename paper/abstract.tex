Docker containers have become the de facto standard for supporting modern enterprise applications due to the highly desirable features of 
isolation, low overhead, and efficient packaging of the execution environment.
%
Containers are created from images that preserve software dependencies,
environment configuration, and other parameters that affect the application's
runtime.
%
Docker allows sharing of such images between users via a Docker registry. 
%
The amount of data Docker registries store is massive; for instance, Docker Hub---a popular public registry---
stores at least a half million public images.
%
%As the amount of images stored in public and private Docker registries
%increases it becomes important to study images' characteristics.
%
%
Investigating the storage-centric properties of containerized applications can reveal useful insights and findings that can enable new optimizations, higher performance, and identification of bottlenecks. 
The massive Docker Hub  dataset of over 50~TB thus offers a unique opportunity for such an endeavor, which we undertake in this paper. We perform the first in-depth analysis of a large scale Docker registry.  
%
%Our goal is to collect statistics from a large amount of Docker images and
%perform a large-scale characterization of Docker images.
%
We characterize images using multiple metrics, e.g., image size distribution,
file size and type distribution, the number of layers per image, the amount of
redundant data between images and layers.

%
Our findings help to make conscious decisions when designing storage for
containers and Docker in particular.
