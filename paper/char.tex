\section{Image, layer, and file characterization}
\label{sec:char}

In this section we carry out our analysis of the Docker Hub dataset by characterizing
layers and images based on
the presented metrics. While overall we are interested in its general structure,
we also analyze specific properties that allow us to draw conclusions regarding the
caching, compression, and resource provisioning.

%In this section, we present comprehensive characterization of Docker images and
%layers.  We analyze and present the highlights of dataset stored by Docker Hub
%registry.  We also provide useful insights (parameters or metrics)
%for the developers to better
%understand the file systems used by Docker container.
