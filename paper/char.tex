\section{Characterization}
\label{sec:char}

In this section we perform storage-oriented characterization of the Docker Hub
dataset and draw our insights.
%
After presenting registry growth trends, we first characterize layers
(\S~\ref{sec:layers}) and then proceed to images (\S~\ref{sec:images}).
%
\paragraph{Docker Hub growth.} Figure~\ref{fig_image_growth} shows the linear
growth in the number of repositories in Docker Hub from May 30 to September 20,
2017.
%
%As discussed in~\cite{XXX}, Crawler searched for `/' by using Docker hub
%search engine, crawled the web page, and obtained the total number of
%non-official public repositories in Docker hub each day. By summing both
%official repository count and non-official repository count, we got the total
%number of repositories in Docker hub each day.
%
During this 110-day period the total number of repositories increased by 53,337
from 633,915 to 687,292, resulting to the average
creation rate of 1,241 repositories daily.
%
The graph is missing the points between July 11 and July 26 because Docker Hub
stopped indexing ``/'' symbol in the repository names (which we originally used
to search for all repositories).
%
We noticed this issues on July 26 and started to use ``*'' symbol instead.
