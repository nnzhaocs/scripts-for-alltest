\section{Dataset Characterization}
\label{sec:char}

In this section we carry out our analysis of the Docker Hub dataset by characterizing
layers (\S~\ref{sec:layers}) and images (\S~\ref{sec:images}) based on
the above presented metrics. While overall we are interested in its general structure,
we also analyze specific properties that allow us to draw conclusions regarding the
caching, compression, and provisioning.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_image_growth}, the number of repositories increased
linearly during our observation period from May 30th to September 20th
2017. Note that the graph shows a gap of 15 days due to Docker Hub changing the way it
indexes repositories. The total number of repositories
grew from 633,915 to 687,292, resulting in an average creation rate of 1,241
repositories per day. This rapid growth shows that storage optimizations will
be crucial for the registry in the future.

%\paragraph{Docker Hub growth}
%%
%Figure~\ref{fig_image_growth} shows the linear
%growth in the number of repositories in Docker Hub from May 30 to September 20,
%2017.
%%
%%As discussed in~\cite{XXX}, Crawler searched for `/' by using Docker hub
%%search engine, crawled the web page, and obtained the total number of
%%non-official public repositories in Docker hub each day. By summing both
%%official repository count and non-official repository count, we got the total
%%number of repositories in Docker hub each day.
%%
%During this 110-day period the total number of repositories increased by 53,337
%from 633,915 to 687,292, resulting to the average creation rate of 1,241
%repositories daily.
%%
%The graph is missing the points between July 11 and July 26 because Docker Hub
%stopped indexing ``/'' symbol in the repository names (which we originally used
%to search for all repositories).
%%
%We noticed this issues on July 26 and started to use ``*'' symbol instead.
